# Mindmaps

This repository contains a few personal mindmaps I use as a reference for cloud security, threat hunting and incident response.

- [AWS Cloud Security 101](./pdf/aws-cloud-security-101.pdf) - most common AWS security incidents and how to avoid them
- [Windows Event Logs](./pdf/windows-basic-event-logs.pdf)
- [Memory Hunting with Volatility](./pdf/memory-hunting.pdf)

## Disclaimer

These mindmaps are for my personal reference and might consequently be incomplete, intentionally or not. Feel free to open an issue for discussion though!
